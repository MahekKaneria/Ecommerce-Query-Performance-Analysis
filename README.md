# Query Performance Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the performance of SQL queries using different indexing strategies: uninformed, self-optimized, and user-optimized. By leveraging SQLite databases created from a Kaggle dataset, the project evaluates how these various approaches impact query execution times.

## Objectives

- **Benchmark Query Performance:** To systematically evaluate and compare the execution times of SQL queries under different indexing strategies across multiple database sizes (small, medium, and large).
- **Visualize Performance Results:** To create visual representations of query performance, facilitating easier comparisons and insights into the efficiency of different indexing methods.
- **Database Construction:** To establish a robust analysis environment by creating databases from the provided Kaggle dataset, ensuring realistic testing conditions.
- **Assess SQL Query Efficiency:** To analyze four specific SQL queries that target various data relationships, demonstrating their performance under different indexing scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate execution times of SQL queries under three indexing scenarios: uninformed, self-optimized, and user-optimized.
- **Visualization:** Generate stacked bar plots to clearly illustrate the performance results across the three database sizes.
- **SQL Queries:** Incorporate four distinct SQL queries that reflect various data relationships and retrieval efficiencies.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Analysis:** The project integrates key data analysis techniques, including performance benchmarking and optimization strategies.
- **SQL Proficiency:** Demonstrates strong SQL skills through the formulation of complex queries and application of indexing strategies.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes Matplotlib for visualizing query performance results, showcasing the ability to present data insights effectively.

## Libraries Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language used for scripting and executing SQL queries.
- **SQLite:** Database management system used to create and handle the databases.
- **Matplotlib:** Library employed for creating visualizations of the query performance results.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations, particularly in data handling and visualization.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a robust demonstration of data analysis capabilities, highlighting the significance of database optimization in real-world applications. The findings underscore how different indexing strategies can substantially affect query performance, providing valuable insights for data analysts and database administrators alike.
